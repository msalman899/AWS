## AWS SAA Certification - Road Map

-	Video courses
	- Acloud guru (good for foundation) (Udemy)
	- DolfinEd AWS CSAA course (Udemy)
	- Stephane Maarek course (Udemy)
-	Go through AWS Documentation for major topics or the ones who you think are your weak area.
-	Tutorialsdojo.com cheat sheet (all of it)
-	AWS FAQs (Major services e.g VPC, S3, EC2, Autoscaling, LB, Lambda CDN etc)
-	Practice test (Tutorialsdojo and Whizlabs) to know your weak topics
-	White papers (just summary)
-	AWS official release readiness course (FREE) [Honestly this course has everything to know before you appear in exam] -- MUST
-	Keep attempting practice test until you score more than 80% (don't memorize the answers)
-	Make your own notes throughout the studies and now just review them. Also, grab some more notes from the internet.  (few links are shared below)
-	EXAM DAY!!!

Note: Join the AWS Reddit community to know people's experiences all over the world and exam feedback. Also, keep in touch with different forums for any leaked questions / scenarios.
This whole will take 2 - 3 months (2 - 3 hours each day, weekend 5 hours)
